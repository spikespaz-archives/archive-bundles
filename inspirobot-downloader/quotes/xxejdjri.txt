Back in the middle ages there was a dimwitted wanderer who was looking for some poontang, when he encountered a tired, old seer.[pause 1] "Can you tell me where to find some poontang?" he asked the seer[pause 1].
The seer quickly replied [pause 1]"of some poontang I do not know, for I am only a seer". The wanderer considered the seer's answer and did as she had said. The following day after hours talking to a friend, the wanderer realized: life itself is infinite but we must still do our best. And then he started to cry.

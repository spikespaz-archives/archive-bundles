A god-fearing hero once approached a gorgeous maiden and asked her "how can it be that you are so great, you who are just a gorgeous maiden?"
"Why, that is because a maiden has a great imagination" replied the maiden.
The hero had never before heard such insight spoken, and after considering the insight for a long time, he was brutally murdered by a relative of the maiden.

# Project Archives (AKA "The Vault")

This repository serves as an archive of my old projects, with commit history preserved in [Git Bundles][1].
This needs to exist because I start and abandon projects, but write too much code to throw away.
Some of these may be revived in the future if I have the spare time and drive required,
but feel free to have a go at working with the sources yourself.

You can download the bundle for each project by clicking the :package: icon, or browse the code online with the :open_file_folder: icon.

After downloading abundle, clone it to a path as if it were a normal repository.
```
git clone <bundle_path> <clone_path>
```
If you want to publish changes, create an empty repository on GitHub, change directory to the bundle's clone directory, and update the remote.
```
git remote set-url --push <your_repository>
```

## Projects

If there is no description for a project, click the :open_file_folder: icon to view the frozen contents of the project's main branch. There is often a `README` that contains either a description, some build information, or both.

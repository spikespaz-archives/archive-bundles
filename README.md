# About Me

I’m a Junior computer science student in a specialty school in Arizona. I am nearly entirely self-taught, I spend most of my personal time programming, and occasionally playing games with friends. **I value user experience, performance, maintainability and quality of code. I always try my best to write software the best way I know how to.** I try by best to make clean, concise source code that will subsequently be maintainable in the future.

My favorite languages are D and Python.
I have a love/hate relationship with JavaScript/CSS/HTML. I use preprocessors when it's convenient.

My first real programming language was Java, with which I created my first Minecraft mod. I've since forgotten most of what I knew about it.

# Projects

No project is ever truly complete. If there are bugs, or important features that need to be fixed or added, I will do so. Many projects marked as "complete" are simply in a functioning state, which I would personally consider to be ready for public release.

## Complete

 - [Search Deflector](https://github.com/spikespaz/search-deflector)
   - An alternative to EdgeDeflector and SearchWithMyBrowser that redirects searches to any search engine of your choice.
   - This is what I would consider to be my most successful project. It is additionally where I taught myself D.
   - ~~Maybe list on Microsoft Store, package as UWP (TODO).~~
     - Done! **You can get the store version [here](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P8ZJJ80RZ2K).**
 - [Clone by Path](https://github.com/spikespaz/clone-by-path)
   - A simple command that, when invoked, attempts to parse a repository path from your current working directory path.
 - [VS Code SmoothType](https://github.com/spikespaz/vscode-smoothtype)
   - An extension to add a smooth typing animation to Visual Studio Code, similar to Microsoft Office and the Windows 10 Mail app.
   - See it on the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=spikespaz.vscode-smoothtype).
 - [Native Dark](https://github.com/spikespaz/firefox-nativedark)
   - Theme for Firefox Quantum that was originally intended to match your Windows accent color and style the browser appropriately. It has since grown into a much larger cross-platform WebExtension.
   - Second-place winner of the [Firefox Quantum Extensions Challenge](https://extensionschallenge.com).
 - [Essential Additions](https://essentialmc.github.io/essentialadditions)
   - My very first ever experience programming (and in creating a semi-successful project). The original was for MC 1.7.10.
   - First experience with basic trigonometry was with the [Ender Eye block](https://github.com/EssentialMC/EssentialAdditions/blob/eae0c7a79a2d8bffe41bf2d42e257119c8479a99/src/main/java/com/spikespaz/essentialadditions/tileentity/TileEntityEyeOre.java#L23-L62), finding the player and watching them like an eyeball.
   - Now unmaintained. The website is broken, but I had some cool stuff on there, such as the Releases page.
   - The website (almost) my first real experience using JavaScript and the GitHub API for something practical.
   - I decompiled and demangled the sources manually, and updated the mod for all versions up to 1.11.2.
   - The [original sources](https://github.com/EssentialMC/EssentialAdditions/tree/1.7.10-legacy) were written when I was approximately 9 years old, and I found a compiled archive on an old flash drive. For the sake of practice, I re-learned Java to rewrite the mod completely, in the [1.7.10](https://github.com/EssentialMC/EssentialAdditions/tree/1.7.10) branch.
   - On the [CurseForge](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/essential-additions) project page there is a lot more information about what this does, along with some nice screenshots.

## Active

 - [GitHub Extended](https://github.com/spikespaz/github-extended)
   - A WebExtension to add metadata to GitHub's website, notmally only accessible through their API.
   - Example: Download counts.
 - [Litemeter](https://github.com/spikespaz/litemeter)
   - Experimental lightweight alternative to Rainmeter, low system resources and high performance. 

## On-hold

 - [New Style Widgets](https://github.com/spikespaz/newstyle-widgets)
   - Fast and lightweight GUI library built on top of modules drom Adam's [arsd](https://github.com/adamdruppe/arsd).
 - [TileDWM](https://github.com/spikespaz/windows-tiledwm)
   - Tiling psuedo-window manager on Windows.
   - A simple and to-the-point program to imitate the functionality of tiling window managers on Linux, such as bspwm and i3wm.
   - Full control over hotkeys to manage the positioning of windows.

## Contributions

Almost all of the forked repositories that I have contributed can be found in my ["Forked Repositories"](https://github.com/spikespaz-forks) organization on GitHub (namespace `spikespaz-forks`). If the fork is dramatic enough to be considered a spin-off project, they will be hosted in my normal user account, [spikespaz](https://github.com/spikespaz).

Some of these are [Awesome Lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) (curated lists of cool stuff relating to a topic). I try to add my projects (if they are worthy) to lists for visibility, to bring in more users and garner interest.

 - [Augment Echo's Website](https://augmentecho.com)
   - Styling fixes, content improvement, general help for my friend.

## Planned

 - [EliteCMDR](https://github.com/spikespaz/elitecmdr)
    - Promised on Reddit but I haven’t had time to start.
    - Voice Attack clone specifically tailored to Elite Dangerous.
    - Does everything based on user keymaps.

 - [spikespaz.com](https://github.com/spikespaz/spikespaz.github.io)
   - Make this site pretty and stuff, ready for presentation.
   - Possibly custom static site generator?
 - [Deezloaded](https://git.teknik.io/spikespaz/deezloaded)
   - Revive Deezloader Reborn (rewrite).
   - Write in a better language, like D.
   - Use [Ultralight](https://ultralig.ht).
   - Maybe use the same UI as Reborn fork, port backend. Or use a CSS-only framework and keep it light.
   - Currently waiting for Ultralight to support SWIG.
 - [µTerm (Micro Term)](https://github.com/spikespaz/uterm)
   - Micro Term (abbreviated µTerm or uTerm, `Alt`+`230`) is a very minimal terminal emulator written using [Ultralight](https://ultralig.ht) and [Xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org).
   - Even though it uses a JavaScript frontend, it is very fast because of the minimal WebKit fork Ultralight.
   - Currently waiting for Ultralight to support SWIG.

## Ideas

 - Sessionify
   - WebExtension similar to TabsAside!
   - More features and a better interface, using custom CSS.
 - RepRap 3D
   - Does same thing as Repetier Host, Cura.
   - Does it better, with a nice interface in Qt, or maybe Ultralight (because it's fast).
   - Keep features like Overrides and Slicing engines from Repetier.
   - Keep the prettiness of Cura's interface, but make it more useful.
   - Make it not slow, because Cura is painful. Make it not ugly like Repetier.
   - Use the actual APIs for the slicers. I think Repetier and Cura use the executable CLI.
   - Maybe a web server for Raspberry Pi?
 - DSymbolizer
   - Use [libdparse](https://github.com/dlang-community/libdparse/) (or [alternative](https://wiki.dlang.org/Lexers_Parsers)) to parse symbols.
   - Output valid D/DI code for use by IntelliSense autocompletion.
   - Only function, class, struct, and method symbols, no implimentation.
   - Add symbols that take type `T` as first param to the class or struct of type `T` (as a member).
   - Fix Uniform Function Call Syntax in [DLS](https://github.com/d-language-server) or [code-d](https://github.com/Pure-D/code-d).
 - Yet Another IRC Client (YAIRC?)
   - But this one is made to look great (Ultralight again).
   - Very similar design to Discord's interface.
   - Renders markdown from messages.
   - Image, video, GIF, and link embeds.
   - Built on New Style Widgets.
 - D for Discord
   - An object orientred wrapper for the Discord API.
   - Made for D language.
 - [Firefox PageInverter](https://github.com/spikespaz/firefox-pageinverter)
   - Forked Firefox extension to invert page colors except images.
   - Persistent across domains, configurable patterns to match URLs.
   - Not made to be perfect like UserStyles, but good enough to be useful.
 - DeNoise
   - Create a virtual audio input device in Windows.
   - Re-route audio in from microphone to this virtual device.
   - Noise gate, noise suppression, other effect options.
   - Train a neural nework on the user's background noise to eliminate background static.
 - Better Notepad
   - Recreate Windows Notepad but better.
   - Smooth typing animation like MS Word.
   - Markdown highlighting and preview.
   - Maybe other markup languages.

   - Cross platform.
   - Drag & Drop shell integration.
   - Interface like a terminal multiplexer, several panels (resembling traditional File Explorer).
   - Keyboard shortcuts. Yes.
 - Open Forum Server
   - Write in Go or vibe.d.
   - Should impliment markdown.
   - May support ReStructuredText and BB script.
 - Euphoric Engine
   - Badass game engine in D language.
   - Support DirectX 11/12, OpenGL 4, and Vulkan.
   - Support other cool new stuff.
   - Compatibility is not a priority.
 - Advanced 3D Sound Engine
   - Simulates latency between ears for surround sound.
   - Computes based on environment variables (direction, volume, location, etc.).
   - Stereo sound is calculated through the relative position of an item in 3D space.
   - Aimed to be scientifically accurate, representing the real way sound travels.
   - Most likely to be implimented into Euphoric engine.
 - Windows System AdBlocker
   - Like AdGuard but FOSS.
   - Finish [Adwin](https://github.com/spikespaz-old/windows-adwin).
   - Make it fast (Adwin is slow because hosts files in Windows don't match patterns).
   - Possibly use [Acrylic](http://mayakron.altervista.org) or use existing server implimentation in language.
   - Operating system-wide, applies ad filters  to all applications that make DNS requests.
 - Office Music Server
   - Plays music in an office environment.
   - Web interface that users can log into like a forum.
   - Vote for tracks, or dislike them.

Centuries ago, in ancient Atlantis, lived a highly regarded dragon slayer who had his home in a hole in the ground[pause 1]. One day, a warrior dropped by his home, and said "greetings, you wouldn't happen to know where I can find the end of the rainbow around here?"[pause 1] Immediately replied "I do not know."
"Why do you behave like this?" asked the warrior.
"That is because 'friendly' is not necessarily 'friendly' to me" replied the dragon slayer[pause 1].
The warrior went berserk and refused to be a slave to the dragon slayer, and the warrior later left the place in tears.

Once, in the early middle ages, there was a well-respected shaman who was wandering around in the jungle trying to acquire a virgin[pause 1]. It was was then that he encountered a wealthy woman.[pause 1]"Can you please tell me where to find a virgin?" he asked the woman[pause 1].
Immediately she answered him: "I have no idea." The shaman fondled the woman and continued his journey. Three days later the shaman made a discovery to himself: each and everyone of us is able to commit horrible atrocities as long as we have faith. And then he took a dagger to his throat and took his own life.

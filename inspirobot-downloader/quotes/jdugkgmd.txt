There was once a beautiful emperor who was wandering around on a desert island searching for ayahuasca[pause 1]. That was when he encountered a fat virgin.[pause 1]"Can you tell me where in the kingdom I can find ayahuasca?" he asked the virgin[pause 1].
The virgin thought long and hard, then she said: "Ayahuasca is to be found where you left it the last time." The emperor considered the virgin's answer and continued his journey. A year later when he was selling his servant, the emperor understood everything: Glorious is the father who knows very corner of his milk. And he became the most worshipped emperor in his village.

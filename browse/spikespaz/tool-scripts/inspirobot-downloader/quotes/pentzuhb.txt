Centuries ago, in ancient China, there was a young traveller who was in search of a dragon in a cave, and encountered a poor priestess.[pause 1] "Where can a young traveller like myself find a dragon?" he asked the priestess[pause 1].
The priestess did not have to think at all.[pause 1] "I have no idea" said the priestess. The traveller considered the priestess's answer and did as she had said. The following winter when he was removing a cow, the traveller finally understood what the priestess had meant: Powerful is a student who fears for his slave. And then he died.

A long time ago lived a brave shaman who was on the lookout for silver, when he spotted an ugly, old priestess.[pause 1] "Where can I find silver?" he asked the priestess[pause 1].
Immediately she answered him: "If you are looking for silver you cannot search in the town square. Search where you left it the last time." The shaman considered the priestess's answer and continued his journey. Later in the evening after hours dying, the shaman realized: existence is terrible if only we do our best. He knew then that his search for silver was over.

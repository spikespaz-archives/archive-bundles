In ancient Egypt, a dimwitted carpenter once approached a crazy, old witch and asked her "tell me my dear witch, how come you are so great, you who are just a crazy, old witch?"[pause 1]
"That is because I do not consider myself a crazy, old witch" replied the witch.
The carpenter had never before heard such words stated so clearly, and after he had thought long and hard about it, he was brutally murdered by a relative of the witch.

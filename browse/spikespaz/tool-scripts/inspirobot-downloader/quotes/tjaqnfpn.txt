A poem from ancient Greece tells the legend of a dimwitted weaver who was living in a mountain[pause 1]. One day, a prince came to see him, and said "greetings, my good weaver, do you know where I can find a donkey?"[pause 1] The weaver laughed and replied "do come in, for a donkey can be found here in my home"[pause 1]. "A donkey here in a mountain?" asked the prince and the weaver quickly replied "Yes."
"Why do you behave like this?" asked the prince.
"I was not aggressive" replied the weaver[pause 1].
After some thinking the prince decided to become a servant to the weaver, and then he died in his sleep.

# About Me
I'm a Junior computer science student in a specialty school in Arizona. I spend most of my personal time programming, and occasionally playing games with friends. I love new technology and software breakthroughs. I highly value aesthetics, user experience, performance, and especially, maintainablilty and quality of code. I try by best to make clean, concise source code that will subsequently be maintainable in the future.

# Projects

No project is ever truly complete. If there are bugs, or important features that need to be fixed or added, I will do so. Many projects marked as "complete" are simply in a functioning state, which I would personally consider to be ready for public release.

## Complete

 - [Clone by Path](https://github.com/spikespaz/clone-by-path)
   - A simple command that, when invoked, attempts to parse a repository path from your current working directory path.
 - [VS Code SmoothType](https://github.com/spikespaz/vscode-smoothtype)
   - An extension to add a smooth typing animation to Visual Studio Code, similar to Microsoft Office and the Windows 10 Mail app.
   - See it on the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=spikespaz.vscode-smoothtype).
 - [Native Dark](https://github.com/spikespaz/firefox-nativedark)
   - Theme for Firefox Quantum that was originally intended to match your Windows accent color and style the browser appropriately. It has since grown into a much larger cross-platform WebExtension.
   - Second-place winner of the [Firefox Quantum Extensions Challenge](https://extensionschallenge.com).
 - [Search Deflector](https://github.com/spikespaz/search-deflector)
   - An alternative to EdgeDeflector and SearchWithMyBrowser that redirects searches to any search engine of your choice. 

## Active

 - [TileDWM](https://github.com/spikespaz/windows-tiledwm)
   - Tiling psuedo-window manager on Windows.
   - A simple and to-the-point program to imitate the functionality of tiling window managers on Linux, such as bspwm and i3wm.
   - Full control over hotkeys to manage the positioning of windows.
 - [Firefox PageInverter](https://github.com/spikespaz/firefox-pageinverter)
   - Forked Firefox extension to invert page colors except images
   - Persistent across domains, configurable patterns to match URLs
   - Not made to be perfect like UserStyles, but good enough to be useful.

## Soon<sup>TM</sup>

   - Make this site pretty and stuff, ready for presentation
 - [Deezloaded](https://git.teknik.io/spikespaz/deezloaded)
   - Revive Deezloader Reborn (rewrite)
   - Better language, not JavaScript (Either Go or D)

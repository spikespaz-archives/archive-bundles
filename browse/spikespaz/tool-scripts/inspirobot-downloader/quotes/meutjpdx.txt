A long, long time ago there was a lonesome widower who was trying to find a father figure in the jungle, when he encountered a lioness.[pause 1] "Where can I find a father figure?" he asked the lioness[pause 1].
The lioness did not have to think at all.[pause 1] "A father figure can not be found in the jungle. Search everywhere, if you just look hard enough" said the lioness. The widower kissed the lioness. Then he asked for her hand, and she said yes. Ten years later when he was burning himself, the widower made a discovery to himself: Great is the father who offers his donkey his household, but greater is the father who offers his donkey his nuts. And then he died.

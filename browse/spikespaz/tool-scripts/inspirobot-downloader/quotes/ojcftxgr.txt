In the dark ages, a humble shaman once approached an old fortuneteller and asked her "how can it be that you are so praised, you who are merely an old fortuneteller?"[pause 1]
"That is because I do not consider myself an old fortuneteller" replied the fortuneteller.
The shaman had never before heard such wisdom spoken, and took it to his heart and brought it with him for the rest of his life, and a couple of years later, he went home.

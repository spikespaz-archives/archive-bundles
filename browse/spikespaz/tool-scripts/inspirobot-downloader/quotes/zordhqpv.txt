A simple-minded hunter once approached a hag and asked her "how can it be that you are so befriended, you who are only a hag?"
"Oh, the reason for that is that I do not see myself as a hag" replied the hag.
The hunter had never before heard such words spoken, and after hearing this, he died an old and happy hunter.

Back in the early middle ages there was a wise, old warlord who was searching for justice on a desert island, when he spotted a fine, young seamstress.[pause 1] "Seamstress! Where can a wise, old warlord like myself find justice?" he asked the seamstress[pause 1].
The seamstress did not have to think for long.[pause 1] "I have no idea" replied the seamstress. The warlord was puzzled by the seamstress's answer. Then he offered her a diamond as a reward. A couple of days later when he was sacrificing his neighbor, the warlord made a discovery to himself: Brave is a man who masters his drunkenness, for he also shares his moments. And then he died.

Back in the stone age there was a wise, old explorer who was born and raised in a palace by his father who was a woodsman[pause 1]. One day, a traveller came to see him, and said "greetings, kind explorer, where can a traveller like myself find a father?"[pause 1] The explorer thought long and hard. Then he replied "go home you're being rude."
"How can that be?" asked the traveller.
"That is because 'rude' is relative" replied the explorer[pause 1].
The traveller became afraid and refused to be a servant to the explorer, and the traveller later left the place in tears.

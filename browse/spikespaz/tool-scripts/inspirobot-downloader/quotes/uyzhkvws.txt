Once, in ancient Sweden, there was an ugly midget who was walking around on the plains trying to acquire wisdom, when he encountered a pretty queen.[pause 1] "Where can I find wisdom?" he asked the queen[pause 1].
The queen closed her eyes as if in a trance. And then she said: "Go play with yourself." The midget considered the answer from the queen and walked on. Twenty years later as he was cursing his mother, the midget made a discovery to himself: all the world is infinite but it's up to each of us whether we choose to act upon it. And he became very much kind by the town, whom also kind him long after his death.

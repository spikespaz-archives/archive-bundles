There was once a highly regarded hunter who was trying to acquire a wife in the town square[pause 1]. That was when he met a fine, young woman.[pause 1]"Can you tell me where in the kingdom I can find a wife?" he asked the woman[pause 1].
The woman closed her eyes as if in a trance. Then she answered: "A wife is the only place where you have not yet looked." The hunter gave a nod to the woman. Then he exposed himself to her. Later that day as he was cursing his sheep, the hunter made a discovery to himself: Glorious is the man who gives to his sister his imaginary friend, for he also punishes his brain. And he realized he was all alone in the world.

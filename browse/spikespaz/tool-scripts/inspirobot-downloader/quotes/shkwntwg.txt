In ancient India, a dimwitted peasant once approached a gorgeous whore and asked her "how come you are so praised, you who are just a gorgeous whore?"[pause 1]
"I will tell you why. That is because I do not consider myself a gorgeous whore any more than I consider myself a king" replied the whore.
The peasant had never before heard such words this well articulated, and after he had thought long and hard about it, he died in his sleep.

A long time ago lived a god-fearing wild man who was born and raised in a mountain[pause 1]. One day, a midget approached him, and said "greetings, do you have any idea where I can find the end of the rainbow?"[pause 1] The wild man knew better than to talk to any midget and kept his mouth shut.
"Why do you act so reluctant towards me?" asked the midget.
"I was not reluctant" replied the wild man[pause 1].
The midget then understood what the wild man meant, and became like a friend to the wild man, and the midget later left the place in tears.

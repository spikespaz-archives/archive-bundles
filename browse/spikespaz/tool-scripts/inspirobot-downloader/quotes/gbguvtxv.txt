Back in the olden days there was a simple-minded traveller who was walking around on the palace grounds searching for shelter from the storm[pause 1]. That was when he met a gorgeous girl.[pause 1]"Can you tell me where to find shelter from the storm?" he asked the girl[pause 1].
The girl quickly replied [pause 1]"of shelter from the storm I do not know, for I am only a girl". The traveller considered the girl's answer and continued his journey. When the girl was gone when he was burning his beard, the traveller had a stroke of insight: all the world is meaningless but we must still do our best. And he became much revered, and when he died his worshippers kept treasuring his memory, and they do so even today, but it's a secret.

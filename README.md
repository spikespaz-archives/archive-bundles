# Projects
## Complete
 - [Clone by Path](https://github.com/spikespaz/clone-by-path)
   - A simple command that, when invoked, attempts to parse a repository path from your current working directory path.

## Active
 - [Native Dark](https://github.com/spikespaz/firefox-nativedark)
   - Theme for Firefox Quantum that was originally intended to match your Windows accent color and style the browser appropriately. It has since grown into a much larger cross-platform WebExtension.
   - Second-place winner of the [Firefox Quantum Extensions Challenge](https://extensionschallenge.com).
 - [Search Deflector](https://github.com/spikespaz/search-deflector)
   - An alternative to EdgeDeflector and SearchWithMyBrowser that redirects searches to any search engine of your choice. 

## Ideas
 - [ ] Better Notepad
   - Recreate Windows Notepad but better
   - Smooth typing animation like MS Word
   - Markdown highlighting and preview
   - Maybe other markup languages
 - [ ] Terminal file explorer
   - Cross platform
   - Drag & Drop shell integration
 - [ ] Tiling window manager for Windows
   - Use a fast systems language (probably D)
   - Inspired by bspwm
   - Configurable hotkeys
 - [ ] Faster open forum server
   - Write in Go or vibe.d
   - Should impliment markdown
   - May support ReStructuredText and BB script
 - [ ] Better extension for Instapaper
   - Instaread is the official plugin, but it sucks
   - Add context menu item
   - Read window action
   - Save page action
 - [ ] Euphoric Engine
   - Badass game engine in D language
   - Support DirectX 11/12, OpenGL 4, and Vulkan
   - Support other cool new stuff
   - Compatibility is not a priority
 - [ ] Windows system-wide adblocker
   - Finish [Adwin](https://github.com/spikespaz-old/windows-adwin)
   - Make it fast (Adwin is slow because hosts files in Windows don't match patterns)
   - Possibly use [Acrylic](http://mayakron.altervista.org) or use existing server implimentation in language

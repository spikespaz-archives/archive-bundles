A god-fearing weaver once approached a crazy, old beggar and asked her "how can it be that you are so admired, you who are such a crazy, old beggar?"
"The reason for is that I do not consider myself a crazy, old beggar any more than I consider myself a knight" replied the beggar.
The weaver had never before heard such insight spoken, and took it to his heart and brought it with him for the rest of his life, and a couple of years later, he became known as the most admired weaver ever to have lived.

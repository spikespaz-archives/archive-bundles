A poem from ancient Rome tells the story about a hideous thief who was going around in the village looking for money[pause 1]. That was when he came upon a beautiful fortuneteller.[pause 1]"Where can a hideous thief like myself find money?" he asked the fortuneteller[pause 1].
The fortuneteller did not have to think for even a second.[pause 1] "Money is to be found in the house where you were born" said the fortuneteller. The thief groped the fortuneteller. Then he sat down and meditated ten years later while he was dying, the thief finally understood what the fortuneteller had meant: existence is a dream but it's up to each of us whether we choose to act upon it. And became very much appreciated, and was also appreciated long after his death.

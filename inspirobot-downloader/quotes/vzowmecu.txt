A dimwitted king once approached an attractive princess and asked her "why is it so that you are so nice, you who are merely an attractive princess?"
"I will tell you why. That is because I know that I always do my best" replied the princess.
The king had never before heard such insight this well articulated, and remembered it for the rest of his life, and later in his life, he jumped off a cliff.

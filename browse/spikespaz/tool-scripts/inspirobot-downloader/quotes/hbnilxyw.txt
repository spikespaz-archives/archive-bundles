A long, long time ago lived an ugly fiddler who was born and raised in a hole in the ground[pause 1]. One day, a traveller approached him, and said "good day, where can a traveller like myself find salt?"[pause 1] The fiddler quickly answered "come in, for I always keep salt around just in case"[pause 1]. "Salt here in a hole in the ground?" asked the traveller and the fiddler quickly replied "Absolutely."
"How can that be?" asked the traveller.
"That is because brave is a husband who hides his quotes, for he shall win peace in his grave." replied the fiddler[pause 1].
The traveller then understood what the fiddler meant, and became like a cousin to the fiddler, and then he died in his sleep.

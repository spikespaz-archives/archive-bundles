There was once a fearless tailor who was wandering around by the countryside trying to acquire the ultimate weapon, when he spotted a young and fair woman.[pause 1] "Where can a fearless tailor like myself find the ultimate weapon?" he asked the woman[pause 1].
The woman thought long and hard, then she said: "I do not know." The tailor became confused by the woman's answer. Then he picked up a rock and struck her dead. That night when he was feeding his harvest, the tailor understood: each human being is already in possession of the ultimate weapon but we must still do our best. And there was much rejoice.

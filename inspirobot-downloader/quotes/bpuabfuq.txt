Centuries ago, in ancient Sweden, lived a lazy warrior who was walking around in the town square searching for salt[pause 1]. That was when he ran into a crooked, old hag.[pause 1]"Dearest hag, wilt thou tell me where a lazy warrior like myself find salt?" he asked the hag[pause 1].
The hag closed her eyes as if in a trance. And then she said: "Go play with yourself." The warrior fondled the hag and continued his journey. The following night the warrior made a discovery to himself: we are each and everyone is all-knowing but we must still do our best. And then he died.

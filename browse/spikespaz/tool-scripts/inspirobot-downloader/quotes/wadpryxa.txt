Back in ancient India there was a wise, old merchant who was on a quest for peace and quiet[pause 1]. It was was then that he encountered a crazy, old widow.[pause 1]"Where can a wise, old merchant like myself find peace and quiet?" he asked the widow[pause 1].
The widow immediately replied [pause 1]"of peace and quiet I do not know, for I am but a mere widow". The merchant thought long and hard about the widow's answer. Then he cried. A couple of days later after hours talking to a friend, the merchant had a stroke of insight: Respected is a student who shares with a stranger his apples. And not a day went by when he did not thank the widow.

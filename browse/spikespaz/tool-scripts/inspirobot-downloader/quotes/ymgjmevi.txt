A greedy clergyman once approached an old widow and asked her "tell me widow, how come you are so respected, you who are only an old widow?"
"I will tell you why. That is because I always try to keep in mind that that: Much treasured is the student who reveals his bed, for he shall receive his inheritance." replied the widow.
The clergyman had never before heard such insight stated so clearly, and after considering the insight for a long time, he was never heard from again.

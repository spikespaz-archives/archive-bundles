Once, in ancient Japan, there was a well-respected blacksmith who was trying to acquire a heir on a desert island[pause 1]. That was when he ran into an old single mother.[pause 1]"Dearest single mother, can you please tell me where a well-respected blacksmith like myself find a heir?" he asked the single mother[pause 1].
The single mother quickly replied [pause 1]"of a heir I do not know, for I am only a single mother". The blacksmith thought long and hard about the single mother's answer and continued his journey. The following night while he was talking to his wife, the blacksmith finally understood everything: Blessed is the father who straightens his lips, for he also restrains his ideas. Shortly thereafter he found a heir and he was never worried again.

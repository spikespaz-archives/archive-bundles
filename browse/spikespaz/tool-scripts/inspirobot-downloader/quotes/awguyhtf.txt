Back in ancient Japan there was a brave warlord who was wandering around in the wilderness looking for cattle[pause 1]. That was when he met a fine, young single mother.[pause 1]"Can you tell me where in the kingdom I can find cattle?" he asked the single mother[pause 1].
Immediately she answered him: "I do not know." The warlord considered the single mother's answer and continued his journey. Twenty years later when he was washing his apple tree, the warlord came to the realization: every human life is infinite in its own way if only we do our best. And there was much rejoice.

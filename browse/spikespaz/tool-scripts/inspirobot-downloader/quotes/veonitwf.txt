A poem from ancient Atlantis tells the story about a simple-minded man who was trying to find insight in the wetlands, when he ran into a mentally challenged witch.[pause 1] "Where can I find insight?" he asked the witch[pause 1].
The witch did not have to think for long.[pause 1] "Insight is to be found inwards" replied the witch. The man thanked the witch. Then he gave her his only son. The following winter the man realized: Popular is the student who cleans his blood, but more popular is the student who cleans his sanity. And there was much rejoice.

A dimwitted fishmonger once approached a beautiful beggar and asked her "tell me dear beggar, how come you are so wise, you who are merely a beautiful beggar?"
"Oh, the reason for that is that a beautiful beggar is only a beautiful beggar if the a beautiful beggar thinks herself to be a beautiful beggar" replied the beggar.
Upon hearing this the fishmonger became sure that the beggar had pulled some kind of trick on him, and after he had thought long and hard about it, he jumped off a cliff.

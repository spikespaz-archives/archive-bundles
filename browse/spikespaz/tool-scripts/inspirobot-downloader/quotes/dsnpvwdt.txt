Once upon a time in China during the Ming Dynasty, lived a god-fearing dragon slayer who lived at home with his uncle[pause 1]. One day, a thief came by him, and said "good day, kind dragon slayer, you wouldn't happen to know where I can find shelter for the night around here?"[pause 1] The dragon slayer refused to answer.
"Why are you so friendly towards me?" asked the thief.
"That is because I want you as a lover." "a lover?" asked the thief. "That's right. A lover" replied the dragon slayer[pause 1].
After some thinking the thief decided to become a lover to the dragon slayer, and when he was dead the dragon slayer was revered the most was declared dragon slayer ever in history.

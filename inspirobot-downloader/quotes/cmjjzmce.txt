Once, in the old world, there was a wise, old gnome who was searching for a place to rest throughout the land[pause 1]. That was when he came upon a mentally challenged fortuneteller.[pause 1]"Dearest fortuneteller, wilt thou tell me where a wise, old gnome like myself find a place to rest?" he asked the fortuneteller[pause 1].
The fortuneteller immediately replied [pause 1]"of a place to rest I do not know, for I am but a mere fortuneteller". The gnome blessed the fortuneteller and continued his journey. Later that day as he was complaining about his neighbor, the gnome came to the realization: we are each and everyone is created from love as long as we have faith. And then he started to cry.

Long ago, in ancient Sweden, there was a wise, old giant who was on the lookout for the key to eternal happiness, when he spotted a crooked, old single mother.[pause 1] "Dearest single mother, wilt thou tell me where a wise, old giant like myself find the key to eternal happiness?" he asked the single mother[pause 1].
The single mother did not have to think at all.[pause 1] "I have no idea" said the single mother. The giant thought long and hard about the answer from the single mother. Then he gave her intercourse. When the single mother was gone the giant understood everything: Lawful is the father who punishes his imaginary friend, but moral is the father who punishes his dung. And that's how he realized that the key to eternal happiness had been inside him all along.

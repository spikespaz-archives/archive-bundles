Once, in ancient China, there was a fearless butcher who had his home in the mountains[pause 1]. One day, a carpenter came to his home, and said "greetings, my good butcher, you wouldn't happen to know where a carpenter like myself can find a father figure around here?"[pause 1] Immediately replied "come in, for I always keep a father figure around just in case"[pause 1]. "A father figure here in the mountains?" asked the carpenter and the butcher quickly replied "That's right."
"How can that be?" asked the carpenter.
"That is because I want you as a brother." "a brother?" asked the carpenter. "That's right. A brother" replied the butcher[pause 1].
After some thinking the carpenter decided to become a brother to the butcher, and the carpenter later left the place in tears.

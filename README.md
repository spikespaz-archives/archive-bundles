# Dear End User, BREAK THIS!

Hopefully it runs on your system.

To start, double click `jvtgui.dist/run_jvtgui.bat`.
On Linux we have `jvtgui.dist/run_jvtgui.sh`. This project *should* be cross-platform.

Try editing that file too by uncommenting appropriate lines.
Remember to comment the ones you don't want to use.
Take a look at the start file for Linux (`run_jvtgui.sh`) for more commentary.

Configuration files and downloads are stored in `~/.jvman/Downloads`.
For me that would be `C:/Users/spike/.jvman`. Open that and poke around.

In the future I'll add an option for customizing the theme in the `settings.json` file.

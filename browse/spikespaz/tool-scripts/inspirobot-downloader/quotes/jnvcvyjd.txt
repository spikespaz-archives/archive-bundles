In the dark ages, a humble dragon slayer once approached an old fortuneteller and asked her "why is it so that you are so beloved, you who are such an old fortuneteller?"[pause 1]
"The reason for is that I do not consider myself an old fortuneteller any more than I consider myself a soldier" replied the fortuneteller.
The dragon slayer had never before heard such wisdom stated so clearly, and took it to his heart and took it with him for the rest of his life, and a couple of years later, he was never heard from again.

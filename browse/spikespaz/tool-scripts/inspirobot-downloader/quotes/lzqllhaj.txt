A poem from ancient India tells the story about a humble salesman who was trying to acquire a giant to slay, when he came upon an unmarried witch.[pause 1] "Dearest witch, wilt thou tell me where a humble salesman like myself find a giant to slay?" he asked the witch[pause 1].
The witch did not have to think at all.[pause 1] "What you are looking for cannot be throughout the land. Search only in death" said the witch. The salesman blessed the witch and walked on. A couple of days later the salesman understood everything: Generous is the pupil who believes in his uncle, but more generous is the pupil who believes in his trouser snake. Shortly thereafter he found a giant to slay and he was never lonely again.

In the old world, a wise, old traveller once approached an ugly, old girl and asked her "why is it so that you are so nice, you who are but an ugly, old girl?"[pause 1]
"Why, that is because I am certain that it's not really up to me whether I am nice or not" replied the girl.
The traveller had never before heard such words spoken, and took it to his heart and carried it with him for the rest of his life, and a couple of years later, he died in his sleep.

In the stone age, a dimwitted explorer once approached a pretty princess and asked her "how can it be that you are so kind, you who are only a pretty princess?"[pause 1]
"The reason for is that I am certain that I can do whatever I feel like" replied the princess.
The explorer had never before heard such truth spoken, and carried it with him for the rest of his life, and later in his life, he died in his sleep.

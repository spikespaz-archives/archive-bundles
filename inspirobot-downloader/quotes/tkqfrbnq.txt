Once, in ancient Greece, there was a highly regarded salesman who was living in a palace[pause 1]. One day, a carpenter came to his home, and said "good evening, kind salesman, where can I find some poontang?"[pause 1] Immediately replied "come in, for I always keep some poontang around just in case"[pause 1]. "Some poontang here in a palace?" asked the carpenter and the salesman quickly replied "Absolutely."
"Why so aggressive?" asked the carpenter.
"That is because 'aggressive' is relative" replied the salesman[pause 1].
The carpenter then understood what the salesman meant, and became like a lover to the salesman, and when he passed on the salesman was nice the most was declared salesman ever in history.

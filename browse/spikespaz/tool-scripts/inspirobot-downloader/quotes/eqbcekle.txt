Back in the stone age there was a humble boy who was going around in the town square trying to find salt, when he ran into a pretty seamstress.[pause 1] "Can you please tell me where to find salt?" he asked the seamstress[pause 1].
The seamstress did not have to think for even a second.[pause 1] "Go play with yourself" said the seamstress. The boy turned away from the seamstress. Then he murdered her and dumped her body in a well. Seven days later after hours thinking, the boy finally understood everything: Unwise is a student who is proud of his harp, but even lesser wise is a student who is proud of his moments. And he became much appreciated, and when he died the town raised a temple in the house where he lived which stands there to this day.

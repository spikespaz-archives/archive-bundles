A long, long time ago lived a beautiful tailor who was wandering around by the countryside in search of peace and quiet, when he encountered a gorgeous single mother.[pause 1] "Can you tell me where in the kingdom I can find peace and quiet?" he asked the single mother[pause 1].
The single mother did not have to think at all.[pause 1] "Peace and quiet is to be found where you left it the last time" said the single mother. The tailor became confused by the single mother's answer. Then he sat down and meditated the following spring after hours flogging himself, the tailor had an epiphany: life itself is incredible and that's just how it is. And he realized he was all alone in the world.

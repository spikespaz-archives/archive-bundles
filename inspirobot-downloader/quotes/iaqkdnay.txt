Long ago, in the middle ages, there was a highly respected king who was born and raised in the desert[pause 1]. One day, a shepherd came by him, and said "pardon me, dear king, you wouldn't happen to know where a shepherd like myself can find God around here?"[pause 1] The king kept quiet.
"Why are you so polite towards me?" asked the shepherd.
"That is because 'polite' depends on your world view" replied the king[pause 1].
The shepherd then understood what the king meant, and became like a brother to the king, and then he died.

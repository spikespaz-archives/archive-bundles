A lonesome man once approached a crazy, old virgin and asked her "how can it be that you are so kind, you who are but a crazy, old virgin?"
"The reason for is that I do not consider myself a crazy, old virgin any more than I consider myself a giant" replied the virgin.
The man had never before heard such words put so plain, and after thinking about it for a long time, he went home.

In ancient Rome, a young prince once approached a mentally challenged beggar and asked her "why is it so that you are so revered, you who are such a mentally challenged beggar?"[pause 1]
"Oh, the reason for that is that I always ensure myself that each person I meet with feels revered as well" replied the beggar.
The prince had never before heard such truth stated so clearly, and after meditating on the truth for a long time, he died and went to heaven.

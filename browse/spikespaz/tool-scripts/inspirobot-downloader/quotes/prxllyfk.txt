Once, in the early middle ages, there was a fearless fiddler who was going around in the village trying to find the end of the rainbow[pause 1]. That's when he came upon a gorgeous lady.[pause 1]"Dearest lady, can you please tell me where a fearless fiddler like myself find the end of the rainbow?" he asked the lady[pause 1].
The lady did not have to think for long.[pause 1] "What you are looking for cannot be in the village. Search inwards" replied the lady. The fiddler thought long and hard about the lady's answer and took her advice to heart. When the lady was gone as he was whipping his beard, the fiddler had an epiphany: each and everyone of us is capable of great madness but it's up to each of us whether we choose to act upon it. And then he died.

A dimwitted gnome once approached a young princess and asked her "tell me dear princess, how come you are so beloved, you who are only a young princess?"
"Why, that is because I do not consider myself a young princess" replied the princess.
The gnome had never before heard such truth stated so clearly, and after considering its ramifications for a long time, he died in his sleep.

A greedy fiddler once approached a young and fair witch and asked her "tell me my good witch, how come you are so nice, you who are but a young and fair witch?"
"The reason for is that I do not see myself as a young and fair witch" replied the witch.
The fiddler had never before heard such insight stated so clearly, and remembered it for the rest of his life, and later in his life, he killed himself.

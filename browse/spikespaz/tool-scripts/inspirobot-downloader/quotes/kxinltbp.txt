A long time ago there was a beautiful salesman who lived at home with a hunter[pause 1]. One day, a king came to where he lived, and said "hello, where can a king like myself find blueberries?"[pause 1] The salesman knew better than to talk to any king and kept his mouth shut.
"Why do you behave in such a manner?" asked the king.
"That is because wealthy is the father who enjoys his magic, for he also obeys his ideas." replied the salesman[pause 1].
After some thinking the king decided to become a brother to the salesman, and later that fall he died under mysterious circumstances.

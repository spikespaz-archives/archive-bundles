A lonesome fiddler once approached a young hag and asked her "tell me hag, how come you are so appreciated, you who are only a young hag?"
"Oh, the reason for that is that I primarily ensure myself that every man and woman I meet with feels as appreciated as myself" replied the hag.
When hearing this the fiddler became sure that the hag had made fun of him, and took it to his heart and remembered it for the rest of his life, and a couple of years later, he died unhappy.

In the middle ages, a bald-headed salesman once approached a young whore and asked her "why is it so that you are so respected, you who are only a young whore?"[pause 1]
"The reason for is that I am certain that I am honest" replied the whore.
The salesman had never before heard such words stated so clearly, and took it with him for the rest of his life, and later in his life, he jumped off a cliff.

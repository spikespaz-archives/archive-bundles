A humble hero once approached a poor single mother and asked her "tell me my good single mother, how come you are so respected, you who are only a poor single mother?"
"I will tell you why. That is because I always try to remember that: Popular is a friend who shares with his brother his wine, but more popular is a friend who shares with his brother his gold." replied the single mother.
After hearing this the hero became sure that the single mother had performed some sort of witchcraft on him, and took it to his heart and brought it with him for the rest of his life, and a couple of years later, he became romantic with the single mother.

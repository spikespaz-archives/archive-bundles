Once, in ancient Atlantis, there was a bald-headed philosopher who was on the lookout for a lamb[pause 1]. It was was then that he encountered a fat witch.[pause 1]"Can you tell me where to find a lamb?" he asked the witch[pause 1].
The witch thought long and hard, and then she said: "What you are looking for cannot be in the mountains. Search within you." The philosopher became confused by the witch's answer and walked on. The following autumn when he was punishing his wife, the philosopher had a stroke of insight: Powerful is the man who creates his life, for he shall become in possession of cheese. And he became very much intelligent by the townsfolk, whom also intelligent him long after his death.

In the old world, a poor wild man once approached a fat whore and asked her "why is it so that you are so praised, you who are but a fat whore?"[pause 1]
"I will tell you why. That is because a whore never forgets" replied the whore.
The wild man had never before heard such words spoken, and took it to his heart and remembered it for the rest of his life, and a couple of years later, he died and realised he had been living a lie.

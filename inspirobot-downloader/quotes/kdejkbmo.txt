A god-fearing marksman once approached a fine, young lady and asked her "why is it so that you are so respected, you who are only a fine, young lady?"
"The reason for is that I know that I can do whatever I feel like" replied the lady.
The marksman had never before heard such insight spoken, and after thinking about it for a long time, he burned the lady.

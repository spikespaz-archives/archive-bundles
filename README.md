# New Style Widgets

This small D library is a collection of widgets drawn with NanoVega on Adam Ruppe's `simpledisplay.d`.
I created this out of frustration while trying to use Blendish. It had several issues,
firstly it did not offer much by way of customizing the appearance of the widgets (or at least easily).

I plan to update this project regularly with new widgets, and possibly in the future will implement a higher
level of abstraction that handles controls and inputs. As it stands, this simply draws graphics to the
window canvas.

## To-Do

This is a list of widgets I plan to impliment, in no particular order. I will add to the list as they come to me.

- [X] Check Box
- [X] Background
- [ ] Choice Button
- [ ] Color Picker
- [ ] Images
- [ ] Buttons
- [ ] Text Label
- [ ] Group Box
- [ ] Radio Buttons
- [ ] Scroll Bars
- [ ] Sliders
- [ ] Number Inputs
- [ ] Text Input
- [ ] List Box
- [ ] Progress Bar
- [ ] Tool Tip
- [ ] Menu Bar
- [ ] Page Tabs

Layout widgets common in other GUI libraries will never be implimented. I want to keep this as simple as possible, and that means you have to do the math on positioning and sizing.

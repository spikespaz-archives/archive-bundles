A wise, old farmer once approached an unmarried princess and asked her "tell me my good princess, how come you are so kind, you who are but an unmarried princess?"
"That is because I am not really an unmarried princess" replied the princess.
The farmer had never before heard such truth stated so clearly, and after meditating on the truth for a long time, he was betrayed by his own brother and sentenced to death.

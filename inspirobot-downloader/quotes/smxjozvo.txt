There was once a bald-headed weaver who lived in a mountain[pause 1]. One day, a philosopher visited him, and said "pardon me, dear weaver, you wouldn't happen to know where I can find eternal happiness around here?"[pause 1] Immediately replied "I do not know of eternal happiness for I am but a weaver."
"How come?" asked the philosopher.
"That is because I know that a philosopher is a cousin as much as a cousin is a cousin" replied the weaver[pause 1].
The philosopher refused to be a cousin to the weaver, and then he died in his sleep.

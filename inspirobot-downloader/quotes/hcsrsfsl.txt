A well-respected woodsman once approached an unmarried girl and asked her "how come you are so liked, you who are merely an unmarried girl?"
"Why, that is because I am not really an unmarried girl" replied the girl.
Upon hearing this the woodsman became sure that the girl had pulled some kind of trick on him, and remembered it for the rest of his life, and later in his life, he died unhappy.

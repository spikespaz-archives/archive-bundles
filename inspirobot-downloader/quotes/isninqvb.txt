In ancient India, a simple-minded tailor once approached a tired, old woman and asked her "how come you are so admired, you who are merely a tired, old woman?"[pause 1]
"I will tell you why. That is because I always try to keep in mind that that: Much beloved is the husband who offers his mother his bed, for he also gives to his mother his moments." replied the woman.
After hearing this the tailor became sure that the woman had performed some kind of magic trick on him, and after meditating on the truth for a long time, he hung himself.

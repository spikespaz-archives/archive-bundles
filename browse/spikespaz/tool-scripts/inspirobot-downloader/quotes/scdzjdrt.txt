A wise, old farmer once approached an attractive queen and asked her "how can it be that you are so adored, you who are merely an attractive queen?"
"That is because an attractive queen is only an attractive queen if the an attractive queen thinks herself to be an attractive queen" replied the queen.
The farmer had never before heard such insight this well articulated, and after meditating on the insight for a long time, he died unhappy.

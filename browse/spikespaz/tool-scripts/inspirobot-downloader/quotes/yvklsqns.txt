A dimwitted emperor once approached a crazy, old queen and asked her "why is it so that you are so liked, you who are but a crazy, old queen?"
"The reason for is that I know that I do as good as I can, even though I'm just a queen" replied the queen.
The emperor had never before heard such truth this well articulated, and took it with him for the rest of his life, and later in his life, he went home.

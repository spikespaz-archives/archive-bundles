In ancient Tibet, a poor marksman once approached an unmarried princess and asked her "tell me princess, how come you are so liked, you who are such an unmarried princess?"[pause 1]
"The answer to that is because I always primarily ensure myself that each human being I come across feels as liked as I" replied the princess.
The marksman had never before heard such truth this well articulated, and carried it with him for the rest of his life, and later in his life, he was killed by one of his relatives.

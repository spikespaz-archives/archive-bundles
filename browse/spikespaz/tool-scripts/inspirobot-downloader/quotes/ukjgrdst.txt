In ancient Atlantis, an old warrior once approached an attractive gorgon and asked her "how can it be that you are so miraculous, you who are merely an attractive gorgon?"[pause 1]
"I will tell you why. That is because an attractive gorgon is only an attractive gorgon if the an attractive gorgon thinks herself to be an attractive gorgon" replied the gorgon.
The warrior had never before heard such insight spoken, and carried it with him for the rest of his life, and later in his life, he died in his sleep.

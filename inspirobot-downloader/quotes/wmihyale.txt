Back in ancient Atlantis there was a bald-headed fishmonger who was trying to find a good fight[pause 1]. That was when he met a tired, old virgin.[pause 1]"Where can a bald-headed fishmonger like myself find a good fight?" he asked the virgin[pause 1].
The virgin immediately replied [pause 1]"of a good fight I do not know, for I am but a mere virgin". The fishmonger fondled the virgin and took her advice to heart. The following day while he was touching himself, the fishmonger came to the realization: life is terrible but we must still do our best. And he became very much beloved by the local villagers, whom also beloved him long after his death.

In ancient China, a fearless farmer once approached a tired, old girl and asked her "tell me my dear girl, how come you are so kind, you who are such a tired, old girl?"[pause 1]
"That is because I don't see myself as a tired, old girl any more than I see myself as a wanderer" replied the girl.
When hearing this the farmer became sure that the girl had bullied him, and took it with him for the rest of his life, and later in his life, he was brutally murdered by a relative of the girl.

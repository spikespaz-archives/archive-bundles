In pre-colonial South America, a wise, old weaver once approached a witch and asked her "tell me witch, how come you are so intelligent, you who are just a witch?"[pause 1]
"I will tell you why. That is because I always try to keep in mind that that: a witch is only a witch if the a witch thinks herself to be a witch" replied the witch.
The weaver had never before heard such wisdom stated so clearly, and after considering its ramifications for a long time, he swore that he's never speak to a witch again, and he didn't.

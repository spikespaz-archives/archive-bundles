# About Me
I'm a Junior computer science student in a specialty school in Arizona. I spend most of my personal time programming, and occasionally playing games with friends. I love new technology and software breakthroughs. I highly value aesthetics, user experience, performance, and especially, maintainablilty and quality of code. I try by best to make clean, concise source code that will subsequently be maintainable in the future.

# Projects
## Complete

 - [Clone by Path](https://github.com/spikespaz/clone-by-path)
   - A simple command that, when invoked, attempts to parse a repository path from your current working directory path.

## Active

 - [Native Dark](https://github.com/spikespaz/firefox-nativedark)
   - Theme for Firefox Quantum that was originally intended to match your Windows accent color and style the browser appropriately. It has since grown into a much larger cross-platform WebExtension.
   - Second-place winner of the [Firefox Quantum Extensions Challenge](https://extensionschallenge.com).
 - [Search Deflector](https://github.com/spikespaz/search-deflector)
   - An alternative to EdgeDeflector and SearchWithMyBrowser that redirects searches to any search engine of your choice. 

## Soon<sup>TM</sup>

 - [spikespaz.com](https://github.com/spikespaz/spikespaz.github.io)
   - Make this site pretty and stuff, ready for presentation
 - [Deezloaded](https://git.teknik.io/spikespaz/deezloaded)
   - Revive Deezloader Reborn (rewrite)
   - Better language, not JavaScript (Either Go or D)
   - Use Sciter for web frontend

## Ideas

 - DeNoise
   - Create a virtual audio input device in Windows
   - Re-route audio in from microphone to this virtual device
   - Noise gate, noise suppression, other effect options
   - KISS (Keep it Simple Stupid)
 - Better Notepad
   - Recreate Windows Notepad but better
   - Smooth typing animation like MS Word
   - Markdown highlighting and preview
   - Maybe other markup languages
 - Terminal file explorer
   - Cross platform
   - Drag & Drop shell integration
 - Tiling window manager for Windows
   - Use a fast systems language (probably D)
   - Inspired by bspwm
   - Configurable hotkeys
 - Faster open forum server
   - Write in Go or vibe.d
   - Add context menu item
   - Should impliment markdown
   - May support ReStructuredText and BB script
 - Better extension for Instapaper
   - Instaread is the official plugin, but it sucks
   - Read window action
   - Save page action
 - Euphoric Engine
   - Badass game engine in D language
   - Support DirectX 11/12, OpenGL 4, and Vulkan
   - Support other cool new stuff
   - Compatibility is not a priority
 - Windows system-wide adblocker
   - Finish [Adwin](https://github.com/spikespaz-old/windows-adwin)
   - Make it fast (Adwin is slow because hosts files in Windows don't match patterns)
   - Possibly use [Acrylic](http://mayakron.altervista.org) or use existing server implimentation in language
 - Automatic commit markup
   - Add a psuedo-syntax for source-code comments
   - Parses at every commit, and automatically makes message
   - Split file changes or diff sections into different commits
   - Basically adds the ability to create commits as you go, part of the file
   - Annotations removed before push
 - Neural network powered text scaling
   - Netural network that is trained to scale up low-res text
 - Office music server
   - Plays music in an office environment
   - Web interface that users can log into
   - Vote for tracks, or dislike them
   - Suggest tracks to be played
   - Option to anonymously request tracks
 - Super fast key/value file format
   - Statically typed
   - Insane parsing speed
   - Good for serializing some basic data

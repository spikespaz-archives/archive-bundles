Once upon a time in ancient Babylon, there was a lonesome widower who was on a quest for gold in the wilderness, and encountered a beautiful mother.[pause 1] "Dearest mother, can you please tell me where a lonesome widower like myself find gold?" he asked the mother[pause 1].
The mother did not have to think for long.[pause 1] "Gold can not be found in the wilderness. Search in the place you call home" replied the mother. The widower was puzzled by the mother's answer and walked on. Twenty years later when he was fondling his back, the widower realized: Great is the pupil who loves his pain, but greater is the pupil who loves his cart. He never searched for gold again.

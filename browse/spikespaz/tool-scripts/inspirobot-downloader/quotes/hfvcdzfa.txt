A dimwitted traveller once approached an attractive lioness and asked her "why is it so that you are so revered, you who are such an attractive lioness?"
"The reason for is that I don't see myself as an attractive lioness any more than I see myself as a shepherd" replied the lioness.
The traveller had never before heard such truth stated so clearly, and brought it with him for the rest of his life, and later in his life, he went home.

Once upon a time in ancient India, lived a brave emperor who had his home in a tower[pause 1]. One day, a gnome came to him, and said "greetings, dear emperor, you wouldn't happen to know where a gnome like myself can find the elixir of life around here?"[pause 1] The emperor thought long and hard. Then he replied "go home you're being rude."
"Why is that so?" asked the gnome.
"I was not strange" replied the emperor[pause 1].
The gnome became enraged and refused to be a neighbor to the emperor, and they both realized their shortcomings and came to an agreement.

# Marker-Qt
Simple two-panel markdown editor made using Qt.

---

This was intended to be a fast and clean markdown editor, but I have stopped development. The implimentation of the preview panel was also getting difficult, because Qt doesn't have easy support for styling rich text, and the `QWebEngineView` implimentation was laggy.

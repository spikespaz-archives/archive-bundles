Centuries ago, in the old world, lived a lonesome marksman who was going around throughout the land on a quest for the end of the rainbow[pause 1]. That was when he encountered an unmarried seamstress.[pause 1]"Can you tell me where in the kingdom I can find the end of the rainbow?" he asked the seamstress[pause 1].
The seamstress closed her eyes as if in a trance. Then she answered: "The end of the rainbow is not throughout the land. It is where you left it the last time." The marksman laughed at the seamstress and took her advice to heart. When the seamstress was gone as he was cutting his mother, the marksman understood: everything is meaningless but we must still do our best. And he knew that his life had failed.

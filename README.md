# Project Archives (AKA "The Vault")

Archives of my old projects, mostly stored in Git bundles. This needs to exist because I start and abandon projects, but write too much code to throw away.

Every old project is packaged into a Git bundle file, in order to preserve history. To unpack these bundles, simply use the clone command. For example, `git clone ./spikespaz-old.project-name.bundle ./project-name` replacing `project-name` with an appropriate string.

A long time ago there was a simple-minded farmer who had his home in the desert[pause 1]. One day, a philosopher came to visit him, and said "pardon me, my good farmer, where can a philosopher like myself find the most valuable treasure?"[pause 1] The farmer laughed and replied "come in, for I always keep the most valuable treasure around just in case"[pause 1]. "The most valuable treasure here in the desert?" asked the philosopher and the farmer quickly replied "You heard me right."
"Why do you act so reluctant towards me?" asked the philosopher.
"That is because I want you as a brother." "a brother?" asked the philosopher. "You heard me right. A brother" replied the farmer[pause 1].
The philosopher accepted this, and became like a brother to the farmer in all meanings of the world, and they both lived happily ever after.

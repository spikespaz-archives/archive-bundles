In ancient China, a brave peasant once approached a crooked, old seamstress and asked her "how come you are so holy, you who are such a crooked, old seamstress?"[pause 1]
"The answer to that is because I don't see myself as a crooked, old seamstress any more than I see myself as a blacksmith" replied the seamstress.
The peasant had never before heard such truth this well articulated, and remembered it for the rest of his life, and later in his life, he was killed by one of his relatives.

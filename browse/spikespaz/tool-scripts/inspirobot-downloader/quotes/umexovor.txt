A brave blacksmith once approached a beautiful hag and asked her "how come you are so adored, you who are merely a beautiful hag?"
"Oh, the reason for that is that I always ensure myself that every human I talk to feels adored as well" replied the hag.
Upon hearing this the blacksmith became sure that the hag had performed some kind of magic trick on him, and after he had thought long and hard about it, he died an old and happy blacksmith.

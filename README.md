# About Me

I’m a Junior computer science student in a specialty school in Arizona. I am nearly entirely self-taught, I spend most of my personal time programming, and occasionally playing games with friends. **I value user experience, performance, maintainability and quality of code. I always try my best to write software the best way I know how to.** I try by best to make clean, concise source code that will subsequently be maintainable in the future.

My favorite languages are D and Python.
I have a love/hate relationship with JavaScript/CSS/HTML.

My first real programming language was Java, with which I created my first Minecraft mod. I've since forgotten most of what I knew about it.

# Projects

No project is ever truly complete. If there are bugs, or important features that need to be fixed or added, I will do so. Many projects marked as "complete" are simply in a functioning state, which I would personally consider to be ready for public release.

## Complete

 - [Clone by Path](https://github.com/spikespaz/clone-by-path)
   - A simple command that, when invoked, attempts to parse a repository path from your current working directory path.
 - [VS Code SmoothType](https://github.com/spikespaz/vscode-smoothtype)
   - An extension to add a smooth typing animation to Visual Studio Code, similar to Microsoft Office and the Windows 10 Mail app.
   - See it on the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=spikespaz.vscode-smoothtype).
 - [Native Dark](https://github.com/spikespaz/firefox-nativedark)
   - Theme for Firefox Quantum that was originally intended to match your Windows accent color and style the browser appropriately. It has since grown into a much larger cross-platform WebExtension.
   - Second-place winner of the [Firefox Quantum Extensions Challenge](https://extensionschallenge.com).
 - [Search Deflector](https://github.com/spikespaz/search-deflector)
   - An alternative to EdgeDeflector and SearchWithMyBrowser that redirects searches to any search engine of your choice.
   - Maybe list on Microsoft Store, package as UWP (TODO).

## Active

 - [GitHub Extended](https://github.com/spikespaz/github-extended)
   - A WebExtension to add metadata to GitHub's website, notmally only accessible through their API.
   - Example: Download counts.
 - [Litemeter](https://github.com/spikespaz/litemeter)
   - Experimental lightweight alternative to Rainmeter, low system resources and high performance. 

## On-hold

 - [New Style Widgets](https://github.com/spikespaz/newstyle-widgets)
   - Fast and lightweight GUI library built on top of modules drom Adam's [arsd](https://github.com/adamdruppe/arsd).
 - [TileDWM](https://github.com/spikespaz/windows-tiledwm)
   - Tiling psuedo-window manager on Windows.
   - A simple and to-the-point program to imitate the functionality of tiling window managers on Linux, such as bspwm and i3wm.
   - Full control over hotkeys to manage the positioning of windows.

## Contributions

Almost all of the forked repositories that I have contributed can be found in my ["Forked Repositories"](https://github.com/spikespaz-forks) organization on GitHub (namespace `spikespaz-forks`). If the fork is dramatic enough to be considered a spin-off project, they will be hosted in my normal user account, [spikespaz](https://github.com/spikespaz).

Some of these are [Awesome Lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) (curated lists of cool stuff relating to a topic). I try to add my projects (if they are worthy) to lists for visibility, to bring in more users and garner interest.

   - Styling fixes, content improvement, general help for my friend.
   - Basically all of the [PRs](https://github.com/elliottedward327/AugmentEcho/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) for that repository are by me.
 - [VS Code Fix Checksums](https://github.com/lehni/vscode-fix-checksums)
   - Extension to fix Code's checksums after modifying core files, as [SmoothType](https://github.com/spikespaz/vscode-smoothtype) does.

   - Even though it uses a JavaScript frontend, it is very fast because of the minimal WebKit fork Ultralight.
   - Currently waiting for Ultralight to support SWIG.

## Ideas

 - DSymbolizer
   - Use [libdparse](https://github.com/dlang-community/libdparse/) (or [alternative](https://wiki.dlang.org/Lexers_Parsers)) to parse symbols.
   - Output valid D/DI code for use by IntelliSense autocompletion.
   - Only function, class, struct, and method symbols, no implimentation.
   - Add symbols that take type `T` as first param to the class or struct of type `T` (as a member).
   - Fix Uniform Function Call Syntax in [DLS](https://github.com/d-language-server) or [code-d](https://github.com/Pure-D/code-d).

A poem from the early middle ages tells the story about a highly respected wild man who was looking for territorial dominance in the mountains[pause 1]. That was when he ran into a crooked, old fortuneteller.[pause 1]"Where can I find territorial dominance?" he asked the fortuneteller[pause 1].
The fortuneteller closed her eyes as if in a trance. Then she answered: "Go play with yourself." The wild man turned away from the fortuneteller and did as she had said. Later in the evening the wild man understood: each and everyone of us is responsible for our own destiny if only we do our best. And then he took a dagger to his throat and took his own life.

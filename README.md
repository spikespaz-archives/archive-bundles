# deconstruction-table-spigot

Introduces a new uncrafting/deconstruction tool block like the crafting table that deconstructs blocks and items back to their basic components. All server-side!

Check out the [resources branch](https://github.com/spikespaz/deconstruction-table-spigot/tree/resources) and download one of the resource packs (zip file) for the block and item to look right.

Please report bugs here on GitHub with the issue tracker.

The crafting recipe is a crafting table surrounded by eight iron ingots, as shown above.

To cycle through recipes with multiple options for a material (eg. wood from a chest), use the red and green buttons.

A poor warrior once approached a young and fair lady and asked her "how come you are so adored, you who are only a young and fair lady?"
"I will tell you why. That is because I don't see myself as a young and fair lady any more than I see myself as a philosopher" replied the lady.
The warrior had never before heard such words this well articulated, and took it to his heart and brought it with him for the rest of his life, and a couple of years later, he died an old and happy warrior.

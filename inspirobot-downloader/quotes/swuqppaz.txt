Centuries ago, in ancient Sweden, lived a lonesome butcher who lived at home with a hunter[pause 1]. One day, a king surprised him at his home, and said "excuse me, kind butcher, where can a king like myself find a place to rest?"[pause 1] Immediately replied "I do not know."
"How come?" asked the king.
"You do not know the meaning of 'strange'" replied the butcher[pause 1].
The king then understood what the butcher meant, and became like a neighbor to the butcher, and later the butcher killed a gorgeous fortuneteller but that's a whole other story.

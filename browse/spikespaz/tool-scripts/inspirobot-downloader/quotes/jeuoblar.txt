A long time ago lived a greedy tracker who was going around in the forest looking for cattle, when he ran into a filthy priestess.[pause 1] "Priestess! Where can a greedy tracker like myself find cattle?" he asked the priestess[pause 1].
The priestess did not have to think for long.[pause 1] "I do not know" replied the priestess. The tracker thought long and hard about the priestess's answer. Then he asked for her hand, and she said yes. Three days later after hours purchasing grain, the tracker made a discovery to himself: A fool is the husband who fears for his god, but an even greater fool is the husband who fears for his trouser snake. Shortly thereafter he found cattle and he was never sexually unsatisfied again.

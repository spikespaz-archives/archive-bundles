A poem from China during the Ming Dynasty tells the myth of a dimwitted monk who was trying to find a golden ball in the desert[pause 1]. That was when he met a wealthy virgin.[pause 1]"Virgin! Where can I find a golden ball?" he asked the virgin[pause 1].
The virgin did not have to think for long.[pause 1] "Go play with yourself" replied the virgin. The monk considered the virgin's answer and took her advice to heart. Twenty years later the monk finally understood everything: Wise is the father who disguises his eggs, though unwise is the father who disguises his family. And when he expired everybody cried.

# Forge Radial Menu

A simple Forge mod to add a configurable radial menu to Minecraft, able to replace keybinds and command macros.

Everything is configurable. The sizes and colors of the menu elements can be changed in the configuration file.
You can set the icons of the buttons to be either an item from the game or a custom texture by resource location.

If you wish to use custom icons, I recommend using [Resource Loader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/resource-loader) to add your textures.

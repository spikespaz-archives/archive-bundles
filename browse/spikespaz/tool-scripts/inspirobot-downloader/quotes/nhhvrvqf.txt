In ancient China, a highly regarded marksman once approached a fat princess and asked her "why is it so that you are so wise, you who are only a fat princess?"[pause 1]
"The answer to that is because I always remember that: Holy is a student who saves his seed" replied the princess.
The marksman had never before heard such wisdom spoken, and took it to his heart and carried it with him for the rest of his life, and a couple of years later, he died under mysterious circumstances.

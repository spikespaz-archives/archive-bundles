Back in ancient Japan there was a lazy man who was born and raised in the middle of town[pause 1]. One day, a salesman visited him, and said "hello, my good man, do you have any idea where a salesman like myself can find contraceptives?"[pause 1] The man laughed and replied "do come in, for contraceptives can be found here in my home"[pause 1]. "Contraceptives here in the middle of town?" asked the salesman and the man quickly replied "Yes indeed."
"Why do you behave in such a manner?" asked the salesman.
"That is because I want you as a enemy." "a enemy?" asked the salesman. "Yes indeed. A enemy" replied the man[pause 1].
After some thinking the salesman decided to become a enemy to the man, and the man was was forever known to be the most befriended man there ever was.

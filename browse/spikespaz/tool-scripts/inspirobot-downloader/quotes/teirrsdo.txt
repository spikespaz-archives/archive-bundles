In ancient Mesopotamia, a wise, old butcher once approached an ugly, old harlot and asked her "why is it so that you are so miraculous, you who are such an ugly, old harlot?"[pause 1]
"The reason for is that a harlot always does her best" replied the harlot.
The butcher had never before heard such wisdom this well articulated, and took it with him for the rest of his life, and later in his life, he swore that he's never speak to a harlot again, and he didn't.

A dimwitted clergyman once approached a wealthy priestess and asked her "tell me priestess, how come you are so wise, you who are such a wealthy priestess?"
"I will tell you why. That is because a wealthy priestess is only a wealthy priestess if the a wealthy priestess thinks herself to be a wealthy priestess" replied the priestess.
The clergyman had never before heard such words spoken, and after thinking long and hard about it, he died none the wiser.

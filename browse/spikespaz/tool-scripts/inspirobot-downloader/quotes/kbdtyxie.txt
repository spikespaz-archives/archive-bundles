A simple-minded weaver once approached a pretty virgin and asked her "how can it be that you are so liked, you who are only a pretty virgin?"
"Why, that is because I always remember that: Lawful is the father who unleashes his body, but moral is the father who unleashes his donkey." replied the virgin.
The weaver had never before heard such wisdom this well articulated, and after he had thought long and hard about it, he was never heard from again.

A highly respected emperor once approached an unmarried seer and asked her "how come you are so intelligent, you who are merely an unmarried seer?"
"The answer to that is because I am not really an unmarried seer" replied the seer.
The emperor had never before heard such words spoken, and brought it with him for the rest of his life, and later in his life, he died and went to heaven.

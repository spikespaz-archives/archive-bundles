A long time ago lived a wise, old tailor who was on the lookout for silver coins by the countryside, when he ran into a fat girl.[pause 1] "Where can I find silver coins?" he asked the girl[pause 1].
The girl immediately replied [pause 1]"of silver coins I do not know, for I am but a mere girl". The tailor thought long and hard about the girl's answer and did as she had said. When the girl was gone the tailor finally understood what the girl had meant: Highly valued is a friend who profits on his fears, for he also destroys his pain. And not a day went by when he did not thank the girl.

In the dark ages, a poor fool once approached an unmarried girl and asked her "tell me girl, how come you are so liked, you who are such an unmarried girl?"[pause 1]
"The reason for is that a girl is not necessarily a girl in the eyes of God" replied the girl.
The fool had never before heard such wisdom this well articulated, and took it to his heart and carried it with him for the rest of his life, and a couple of years later, he died and went to heaven.

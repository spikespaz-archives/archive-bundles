A long time ago lived a hideous blacksmith who was looking for the ultimate weapon by the countryside, and encountered an unmarried girl.[pause 1] "Girl! Where can I find the ultimate weapon?" he asked the girl[pause 1].
The girl did not have to think for even a second.[pause 1] "What you are looking for cannot be by the countryside. Search inside you" said the girl. The blacksmith was thankful for the answer from the girl and took her advice to heart. The following day the blacksmith had an epiphany: Glorious is the husband who is familiar with his family, for he shall find mindfulness. And then he died.

Once, in the old world, there was a poor prince who was on a quest for justice, when he came upon an attractive seer.[pause 1] "Can you tell me where in the kingdom I can find justice?" he asked the seer[pause 1].
Immediately she answered him: "Justice is to be found the only place where you have not yet looked." The prince thought long and hard about the seer's answer and did as she had said. A couple of days later as he was rubbing his back, the prince realized: life itself is suffering but we must still do our best. Moments later he was in possession of justice and he was never again lost.

A long, long time ago there was a highly regarded knight who was seeking a father figure in a cave, when he ran into an ugly, old woman.[pause 1] "Woman! Where can I find a father figure?" he asked the woman[pause 1].
The woman closed her eyes as if in a trance. Then she said: "A father figure is not in a cave. It is in the mountains." The knight thought long and hard about the woman's answer. Then he laughed at her. Twenty years later the knight finally understood what the woman had meant: every human life is suffering in its own way if only we try our best. And not a day went by when he did not thank the woman.

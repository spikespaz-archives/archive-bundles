In ancient Babylon, a bald-headed carpenter once approached a tired, old beggar and asked her "tell me my good beggar, how come you are so beloved, you who are just a tired, old beggar?"[pause 1]
"Why, that is because a beggar always remembers" replied the beggar.
The carpenter had never before heard such words stated so clearly, and took it to his heart and took it with him for the rest of his life, and a couple of years later, he became known as the most beloved carpenter ever to have lived.

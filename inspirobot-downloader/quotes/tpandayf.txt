A poem from ancient Tibet tells the tale of a highly respected gnome who was in search of fire[pause 1]. That was when he ran into a fine, young priestess.[pause 1]"Can you tell me where in the kingdom I can find fire?" he asked the priestess[pause 1].
Immediately she answered him: "I do not know." The gnome was thankful for the answer from the priestess. Then he laughed at her. The following summer the gnome made his great discovery: all the world is wonderful and that's just how it is. And he was happy for the rest of his life.

A poem from ancient Sweden tells the fable of an ugly emperor who was trying to acquire a magical mushroom in a cave, and encountered a tired, old whore.[pause 1] "Can you tell me where in the kingdom I can find a magical mushroom?" he asked the whore[pause 1].
The whore closed her eyes as if in a trance. Then she answered: "I have no idea." The emperor fondled the whore. Then he went home. Later that day when he was cleaning his back, the emperor made a discovery to himself: Powerful is a husband who respects his ideas, for he also serves his frustration. And then he killed himself.

Once, in ancient Atlantis, there was a lonesome blacksmith whose home was in a hut in the forest[pause 1]. One day, a weaver came by him, and said "pardon me, dear blacksmith, where can I find territory?"[pause 1] The blacksmith knew better than to talk to any weaver and kept his mouth shut.
"How can that be?" asked the weaver.
"That is because I want you as a son." "a son?" asked the weaver. "Yes. A son" replied the blacksmith[pause 1].
After some thinking the weaver decided to become a son to the blacksmith, and then he died in his sleep.

In ancient India, a hideous explorer once approached a poor priestess and asked her "tell me my dear priestess, how come you are so adored, you who are merely a poor priestess?"[pause 1]
"The answer to that is because I always keep in mind that that: a poor priestess is only a poor priestess if the a poor priestess thinks herself to be a poor priestess" replied the priestess.
When hearing this the explorer became sure that the priestess had cast some kind of spell on him, and took it to his heart and took it with him for the rest of his life, and a couple of years later, he swore that he's never speak to a priestess again, and he didn't.

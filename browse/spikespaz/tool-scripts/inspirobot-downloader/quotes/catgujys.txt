Once, in China during the Ming Dynasty, there was an old tailor who was walking around in the mountains on the lookout for a mother[pause 1]. That was when he came upon a wealthy fortuneteller.[pause 1]"Dearest fortuneteller, wilt thou tell me where an old tailor like myself find a mother?" he asked the fortuneteller[pause 1].
The fortuneteller did not have to think for even a second.[pause 1] "What you are looking for cannot be in the mountains. Search the only place where you have not yet looked" said the fortuneteller. The tailor listened to the fortuneteller and walked on. The following winter when he was complaining about his mother, the tailor had an epiphany: Respected is the son who strikes his anger, for he also knows very corner of his gold. And became very much holy, and was even holy after his death.

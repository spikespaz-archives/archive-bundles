A poem from ancient Japan tells an anecdote about a bald-headed boy who was trying to find gold in the courtyard[pause 1]. That was when he ran into a fat maiden.[pause 1]"Can you tell me where in the kingdom I can find gold?" he asked the maiden[pause 1].
The maiden immediately replied [pause 1]"of gold I do not know, for I am but a mere maiden". The boy thought long and hard about the maiden's answer and continued his journey. Ten years later as he was feeding his back, the boy finally understood what the maiden had meant: life itself is terrible and that's just how it is. And he lived happily ever after.

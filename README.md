# About Me

I’m a Junior computer science student in a specialty school in Arizona. I am nearly entirely self-taught, I spend most of my personal time programming, and occasionally playing games with friends. **I value user experience, performance, maintainability and quality of code. I always try my best to write software the best way I know how to.** I try by best to make clean, concise source code that will subsequently be maintainable in the future.

My favorite languages are D and Python.
I have a love/hate relationship with JavaScript/CSS/HTML.

My first real programming language was Java, with which I created my first Minecraft mod. I've since forgotten most of what I knew about it.

# Projects

No project is ever truly complete. If there are bugs, or important features that need to be fixed or added, I will do so. Many projects marked as "complete" are simply in a functioning state, which I would personally consider to be ready for public release.

## Complete

 - [Clone by Path](https://github.com/spikespaz/clone-by-path)
   - A simple command that, when invoked, attempts to parse a repository path from your current working directory path.
 - [VS Code SmoothType](https://github.com/spikespaz/vscode-smoothtype)
   - An extension to add a smooth typing animation to Visual Studio Code, similar to Microsoft Office and the Windows 10 Mail app.
   - See it on the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=spikespaz.vscode-smoothtype).
 - [Native Dark](https://github.com/spikespaz/firefox-nativedark)
   - Theme for Firefox Quantum that was originally intended to match your Windows accent color and style the browser appropriately. It has since grown into a much larger cross-platform WebExtension.
   - Second-place winner of the [Firefox Quantum Extensions Challenge](https://extensionschallenge.com).
 - [Search Deflector](https://github.com/spikespaz/search-deflector)
   - An alternative to EdgeDeflector and SearchWithMyBrowser that redirects searches to any search engine of your choice. 

## Active

- [GitHub Extended](https://github.com/spikespaz/github-extended)
  - A WebExtension to add metadata to GitHub's website, notmally only accessible through their API.
  - Example: Download counts.

## On-hold

 - [New Style Widgets](https://github.com/spikespaz/newstyle-widgets)
   - Fast and lightweight GUI library built on top of modules drom Adam's [arsd](https://github.com/adamdruppe/arsd).
 - [TileDWM](https://github.com/spikespaz/windows-tiledwm)
   - Tiling psuedo-window manager on Windows.
   - A simple and to-the-point program to imitate the functionality of tiling window managers on Linux, such as bspwm and i3wm.
   - Full control over hotkeys to manage the positioning of windows.

## Soon<sup>TM</sup>

 - [spikespaz.com](https://github.com/spikespaz/spikespaz.github.io)
   - Make this site pretty and stuff, ready for presentation
 - [Deezloaded](https://git.teknik.io/spikespaz/deezloaded)
   - Revive Deezloader Reborn (rewrite)
   - Better language, not JavaScript (Either Go or D)
   - Use Sciter for web frontend
 - [µTerm (Micro Term)](https://github.com/spikespaz/uterm)
   - Micro Term (abbreviated µTerm or uTerm, `Alt`+`230`) is a very minimal terminal emulator written using [Ultralight](https://ultralig.ht) and [Xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org).
   - Even though it uses a JavaScript frontend, it is very fast because of the minimal WebKit fork Ultralight.
   - Currently waiting for Ultralight to support SWIG.

## Ideas

 - DSymbolizer
   - Use [libdparse](https://github.com/dlang-community/libdparse/) (or [alternative](https://wiki.dlang.org/Lexers_Parsers)) to parse symbols.
   - Output valid D/DI code for use by IntelliSense autocompletion.
   - Only function, class, struct, and method symbols, no implimentation.
   - Add symbols that take type `T` as first param to the class or struct of type `T` (as a member).
   - Fix Uniform Function Call Syntax in [DLS](https://github.com/d-language-server) or [code-d](https://github.com/Pure-D/code-d).
 - [FastIRC](https://github.com/spikespaz/fastirc)
   - Yet another IRC client, but this one is made to look great.
   - Very similar design to Discord's interface.
   - Renders markdown from messages.
   - Image, video, GIF, and link embeds.
   - Built on New Style Widgets.
 - D for Discord
   - An object orientred wrapper for the Discord API.
   - Made for D language.
 - [Firefox PageInverter](https://github.com/spikespaz/firefox-pageinverter)
   - Forked Firefox extension to invert page colors except images
   - Persistent across domains, configurable patterns to match URLs
   - Not made to be perfect like UserStyles, but good enough to be useful.
 - DeNoise
   - Create a virtual audio input device in Windows
   - Re-route audio in from microphone to this virtual device
   - Noise gate, noise suppression, other effect options
   - Train a neural nework on the user's background noise to eliminate background static

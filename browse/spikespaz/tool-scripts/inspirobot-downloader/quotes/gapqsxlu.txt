In the dark ages, a beautiful farmer once approached a fat witch and asked her "tell me dear witch, how come you are so respected, you who are only a fat witch?"[pause 1]
"Why, that is because I do not see myself as a fat witch" replied the witch.
The farmer had never before heard such truth put so plain, and after thinking about it for a long time, he was betrayed by his allies and murdered.

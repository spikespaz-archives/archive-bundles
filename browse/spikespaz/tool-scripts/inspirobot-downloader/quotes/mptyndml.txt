A simple-minded shaman once approached a pretty mother and asked her "why is it so that you are so admired, you who are only a pretty mother?"
"I will tell you why. That is because I try to make sure that each human being I come across feels unique" replied the mother.
Upon hearing this the shaman became sure that the mother had performed some sort of witchcraft on him, and took it to his heart and remembered it for the rest of his life, and a couple of years later, he killed himself.
